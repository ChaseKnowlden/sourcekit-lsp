# Diagnose Bundle

A diagnose bundle is designed to help SourceKit-LSP developers diagnose and fix reported issues.
You can generate a diagnose bundle with:
```sh
sourcekit-lsp diagnose
```

And then attach the resulting `sourcekit-lsp-diagnose-*` bundle to any bug reports.

You may want to inspect the bundle to determine whether you're willing to share the collected information. At a high level they contain:
- Crash logs from SourceKit
  - From Xcode toolchains, just a stack trace.
  - For assert compilers (ie. nightly toolchains) also sometimes some source code that was currently compiled to cause the crash.
- Log messages emitted by SourceKit
  - We mark all information that may contain private information (source code, file names, â€¦) as private by default, so all of that will be redacted. Private logging can be enabled for SourceKit-LSP as described in [Enable Extended Logging](Enable%20Extended%20Logging.md). On macOS these extended log messages are also included in a sysdiagnose.
- Versions of Swift installed on your system
- If possible, a minimized project that caused SourceKit to crash
- If possible, a minimized project that caused the Swift compiler to crash
